            <p>
                Hi! I’m <strong>Chris Rohan</strong>, a 10th-grade student who loves mathematics, programming, and
                learning beyond the classroom.
            </p>
            <p>
                I completed <strong>AP Calculus AB</strong> in 8th grade and <strong>AP Statistics</strong> in 9th
                grade,
                earning <strong>scores of 5 on both AP Exams</strong>. Math has always been my strongest subject, and I
                enjoy exploring everything from algebra and geometry to calculus and probability.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m also a dedicated <strong>Python coder</strong>. I enjoy creating Python scripts, solving algorithm
                challenges, experimenting with data, and building small applications. Coding allows me to bring ideas to
                life and use logic to solve real problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside academics, I enjoy technology, robotics, gaming, and helping classmates with math. My future
                interests include engineering, software development, and data science.
            </p>
